Interface Monitoring:

We can set up interface monitoring to trigger a failover when an interface goes down. To do this we must:
1. Assign a weight value to each physical interface we want to monitor.
2. If that inteface goes down the weight value is subtracted from the threshold of 255.
3. If the threshold goes to 0 or lower a failover is triggered.

   255 is a non-configurable threshold, each RG has this value.
   
-- The formula for RG and failover is as follows:
       
      * RGx value = RGx threshold â€“ interface weight

NOTE: Multiple physical links in LAG can be a membre of RETH interface, so each link might have a weight value.  

Configuration:

Lets configure interface monitoring using the following commands (SRX210):
# set chassis cluster redundancy-group 1 interface-monitoring ge-0/0/0 weight 255
# set chassis cluster redundancy-group 1 interface-monitoring ge-2/0/0 weight 255

Any interface on the LAN side that goes down on a primary node, will trigger a cluster failover for RG1.


IP Monitoring:

Often it is not possible to detect an outage just by monitoring the status of an interface. We need to do IP monitoring instead.

 -- IP monitoring allows us to monitor upstream IP reachability. Can be multiple upstream routers.
 -- Ping an upstream IP and monitor if we get a response back.
 -- If no response detected in a predefined time period, failover the redundancy group.
 -- Can monitor from our primary and secondary node at the same time.

Secondary Node IP Monitoring:

Monitoring the upstream IP address from our secondary node is very useful, because we can tell if upstream is reachable or not
from the secondary node, if the upstream IP is not reachable then the cluster will not failover. There is no need to.

-- Same or different upstream IP can be monitored from primary/secondary node.
-- Because secondary node interfaces are inactive, we need to define a special secondary-ip-address, pings are sourced from this address.

Configuration
 #edit chassis cluster redundancy-group 1
 #set ip-monitoring global-weight 255                                    (if global-threshold =< 0, RG threshold 255 minus global-weight)
 #set ip-monitoring global-threshold 100                                 (global-threshold minus interface weight)
 #set ip-monitoring retry-interval 1                                     (how often to ping)
 #set ip-monitoring retry-count 5                                        (how many pings can fail)
 #set ip-monitoring family inet 89.68.105.1 weight 100                   (how much to minus from global-threshold)
 #set ip-monitoring family inet 89.68.105.1 interface reth1.0 secondary-ip-address 89.68.105.101 (must be in the same subnet as reth1.0)
 
Verify Failover (Using IP mon.):
-- Issue a continuos ping from PC located on our LAN to the WAN IP while removing WAN cable from Node0
 (Primary for RG1)
 > show chassis cluster status
 > show chassis cluster ip-monitoring status
