Interface Monitoring

We can set up interface monitoring to trigger a failover when an
interface goes down. To do this we must:
1. Assign a weight value to each physical interface we want to
monitor.
2. If that inteface goes down the weight value is subtracted from
the threshold of 255.
3. If the threshold goes to 0 or lower a failover is triggered.
255 is a non-configurable threshold, each RG has this value.

Configuration
Lets configure interface monitoring using the following commands:
# set chassis cluster redundancy-group 1 interface-monitoring ge-0/0/10 weight 255
# set chassis cluster redundancy-group 1 interface-monitoring ge-5/0/10 weight 255
Any interface on the LAN side that goes down on a
primary node, will trigger a cluster failover for RG1.
