Failover Events

Failover can be triggered by various events in our cluster. 

These events can be broken up into 2 groups:
 -- Control Plane events (Redundancy Group 0)
 -- Data Plane events (Redundancy Group 1 and any others)

- Control Plane (RG0) Events

  The Control Plane can be manually or automatically triggered to cause a failover.
--  Manual - forced by using the following command:
 - > request chassis cluster failover redundancy-group 0 node X *//Where X is the node you want to make primary
--  Automatic - critical hardware or software failure, complete power loss.
  - **By default, as a hold time of 5 mins to prevent continues failover.
  
- Data Plane (RG1+) Events

  The Data Plane can be triggered to failover manually, automatically or use configured triggers.
--  Manual - forced by using the following command:
 - > request chassis cluster failover redundancy-group 1 node X 
--  Automatic - critical hardware or software failure, complete power loss, 
    spc (service processing card) failure and memory leaks.

 - Configured triggers - Interface monitoring, IP monitoring and preempt.Reset Manual Failover & Preempt
 - During a manual failover the new primary node will have a priority set to 255
 - If preempt is configured, and we manually failover the RG preempt will no longer work until we “reset” our failover.
 - To reset the cluster after manual failover issue:
  - > request chassis cluster failover reset redudancy group 0
  - > request chassis cluster failover reset redudancy group 1
