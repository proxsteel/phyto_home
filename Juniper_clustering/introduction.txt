SRX HA modes: Active/Passive, Active/Active
Special Interfaces
⬜ FXP0 – Management link(fxp0 or me0, it's platform dependent on the control plane)
⬜ FXP1 – Control link (internal link between RE and PFE, fxp1 or em0)
⬜ Fab1 & Fab0 - Fabric (Data) links
⬜ Reth – Redundant Ethernet interfaces

Control & Management ports
For SRX240:
⬜ Control = ge-0/0/1
⬜ Management = ge-0/0/0
For SRX110:
⬜ Control = fe-0/0/7
⬜ Management = fe-0/0/6

For SRX210:
⬜ Mgmt = fe-0/0/6             == fxp0
⬜ Control = fe-0/0/7          == fxp1
⬜ Fabric/Data = [f/g]e-0/0/2  == fab0

The fabric link connection for the SRX100 must be a pair of Fast Ethernet interfaces 
and for the SRX210 must be a pair of either Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. 
The fabric link connection must be any pair of either Gigabit Ethernet or 10-Gigabit Ethernet 
interfaces on all other SRX Series devices
