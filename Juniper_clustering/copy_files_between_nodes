1. Check the status of the chassis cluster:
   >show chassis cluster status
   
2. Check if the Fabric link is up:
   >show interfaces terse fab*
   Or
   >show interfaces terse | match fab
   
3. After confirming the target node and fabric link are up, proceed with copying the file. For this example, 
   assume that the source file is /var/tmp/abc.log and the target directory is /var/log/. Also, assume that the target node is node1:

   Use either of the following methods:

   CLI: >file copy /var/tmp/abc.tgz node1:/var/tmp/
   Or
   Shell: >start shell user root
          %rcp -T /var/tmp/abc.tgz node1:/var/tmp/

4. switch over between nodes RPs.
  > request routing-engine login node x  *// x is the id numbre of secondary node. to get back to the primary use exit command.
